**How to Use Video Copier Script:
*
*Please be aware that this script is written in Python3 and should run as such. The hashbang should notify the system of this, however for
*future debugging or enhancement, please make note of this.
*This program also has a script to run on Mac as a cron job, or can be used on Windows as a scheduled task. It does not specify for security,
*and will need to be enhanced to do so if this becomes a necessity.
*
*This program is run from the command line if not run as a cron job or scheduled task. The only input necessary is to call it as your normally
*would a Python script from the respective OS. (Python for Windows or Python3 for Mac, then the file name while inside the correct directory.)
*
*Additional documentation on creating cron jobs and scheduled tasks will be specified in other documentation files.
*
*Provided are two scripts. One running with Python's copy2 command which saves *most* metadata. Specific data on which metadata can be lost was not
*available at the time of this scripts writing. Therefore the second script which runs Window's robocopy command from the script was also built
*in order to be sure that all metadata was copied
*
*As it is writen currently, within the copy2 script, the paths for source, destination, and log will need to be input into the code as variables before
*the cron job or scheduled task is put in place.
*In the robocopy script, the log and source will need to be input into the code as variables, however the destination will need to be hard coded into
*the robocopy command within the script.
*
*This script also utilizes the send2trash library. In order to install this library, the command: <pip install send2trash> will need to be performed
*when the script is setup to run. This will be sure that all deleted files are sent to the Trash or Recycle Bin depending on the OS it is used on.
*The library will determine the OS, there is no need to apply any further settings beyond the initial install command.
